# Citations

If you use the CorEx topic model, please cite the following paper:

> Gallagher, R. J., Reing, K., Kale, D., & Ver Steeg, G. (2017). [Anchored Correlation Explanation: Topic Modeling with Minimal Domain Knowledge](/publications/gallagher2017anchored). *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL)*, 5, 529-542.

# Further Reading

More intuition for the CorEx algorithm is given in [these slides](/files/slides/gallagher2017anchored.pdf), along with additional examples of topic modeling with anchor words.

For a more detailed tutorial of how to run the CorEx topic model in Python, extract information from it, choose the number of topics, and run hierarchical and semi-supervised models, see [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/gregversteeg/corex_topic/blob/master/corextopic/example/corex_topic_example.ipynb).

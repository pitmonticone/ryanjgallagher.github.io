# Bayesian Core-Periphery Stochastic Block Models

Core-periphery structure is one of the most ubiquitous mesoscale patterns in networks. We have introduced two Bayesian stochastic block models, implemented in Python, that infer hub-and-spoke and layered core-periphery structures. The models can be used for probabilistic inference of core-periphery structure and model selection between the two core-periphery characterizations.

Details of the core-periphery models are detailed in our preprint:

> Gallagher, Ryan J., Young, Jean-Gabriel, and Foucault Welles, Brooke. (2020). "[A Clarified Typology of Core-Periphery Structure in Networks](/publications/gallagher2020clarified)." *arXiv preprint*.

Open-source implementations of the block models are available in Python [on Github](https://github.com/ryanjgallagher/core_periphery_sbm).
